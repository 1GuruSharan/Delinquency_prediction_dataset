# Delinquency_prediction_dataset
âœ¨ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer credit delinquency risk ðŸ“Š using historical financial and behavioral data. The aim is to enable early identification of at-risk customers, allowing for targeted and fair intervention strategies.

Dataset & Preprocessing
The dataset contains anonymized customer records, including demographics, financial history, credit behavior, and income metrics.
ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing â†’ Cleaning & structuring
ðŸ”¹ Gap Detection â†’ Addressed missing values using statistical imputation for numeric data
ðŸ”¹ Predictive Modeling â†’ Risk classification
ðŸ”¹ Detected and handled outliers to improve model stability.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization â†’ Charts & diagrams for insights
insights

âœ¨ Risk Prediction Model
A machine learning model (Random Forest / XGBoost) was developed to classify customers into three risk categories:

ðŸ”¹Low Risk â€“ minimal intervention required

ðŸ”¹Medium Risk â€“ budget support or payment plan recommended

ðŸ”¹High Risk â€“ hardship support and agent review required

ðŸ”¹ Feature importance analysis highlighted credit utilization ratio, past due payments, and debt-to-income ratio as key predictors.

âœ¨ Insights & Visualization
The model results and insights were presented through:

ðŸ”¹Risk segmentation charts

ðŸ”¹Feature importance plots

ðŸ”¹Performance metrics (accuracy, ROC curves)

âœ¨ Outcome
The solution provides a scalable approach to identify delinquency risk, improve collection efficiency, and maintain fairness in customer treatment.
